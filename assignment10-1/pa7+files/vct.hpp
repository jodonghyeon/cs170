namespace hlp2 {

// provide definition of class template vector:
// 1) Start with the correct implementation of assignment 6.
// 2) Don't forget to add necessary header files [except <vector>].
//    Make sure to remove the previous line because the grader will
//    not allow text <vector> to be present in your source file [remove this line too!!!].
// 3) Add member function: void swap(vector&);
// 4) Rewrite [if necessary] copy assignment operator overloads to follow
//    the copy-and-swap idiom.
// 5) Add member function: void pop_back();
//    What does pop_back() do? It removes the last element in the vector, effectively reducing the container size by one.
// 6) Use your own tests to make sure your class does the right thing for
//    a basic type such as int, standard library type std::string, and user-defined type hlp2::Str
// 7) Just as in class lecture, use these concrete class definitions to define the class template.
// 8) Your implementation must define member functions OUTSIDE the class definition.
//    You will need this practice to correctly answer final test questions!!!
// 9) Make sure your implementation/submission doesn't include <vector>.
//    It is a good idea to delete the previous line once you've read it!!!
// 10) The file must contain a file header documentation block and a file documentation
//    block for each function you're defining (including the ones that have been previously implemented).
