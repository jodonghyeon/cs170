// @todo: Add a file documentation header as explained in the specs ...

#include <stdio.h>   // do not remove

// IMPORTANT NOTE: Other than functions fgetc, printf, or fprintf [which are declared in <stdio.h>],
// you must not use any other C standard library function in your submission.

// You should document [not necessary for grading but an excellent habit
// to acquire] your implementation of functions to aid
// in debugging and maintenance not only by yourself but by others in
// your software development team ...

// Remember, the function-level documentation header in q.h is primarily
// meant for your clients. The documentation header here is primarily for
// use by you [and other on your team] solely to aid maintenance and
// debugging tasks ...

// @todo: Provide the definition(s) of function(s) that
// match the declaration(s) in q.h ...

// For each function -

// Add documentation [for yourself and not for grading] for the function ...
