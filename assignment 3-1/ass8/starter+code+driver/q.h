// The auto-grader will not accept your submission if this file
// contains include directives.

// for clients to correctly use the function. Provide a documention block
// for each declared function that contains the following information:
// What does the function do?
// What are the (types) of the parameters?
// What is the (type) of value returned by function?
// Is there any particular input that will break the function?
